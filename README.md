See [`package.json`](./package.json) for all other requirements. Bootstrapped using [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg).

## Installation

- [Node.js][node-js]
  - Use Node v16 (LTS). Anything higher or lower may not be compatible.

This project uses `yarn` for package management. Install `yarn` with `npm` via `npm install --global yarn`.

This project requires credentials to run properly. See [Database](#Database).

## Development

For easy development, `yarn run dev` will start Next.js with hot-reloading & error reporting.

Build for production with `yarn run build` for a production-ready version of the site.
To execute it locally, execute `yarn run start`. Features like hot-reloading will not be available.

Analysis of package sizes in a built website can be conducted with `yarn run analyze`; this will build like `yarn run build`,
but will generate (and open) build reports useful for understanding the site's webpack size.

Lastly, some environment variables are required. In `.env`, define these variables (values are your choice, but must not be null):

```dotenv
ADMIN_UNAME=acm
ADMIN_PASS=123
EVENT_PAGE_REVALIDATION_TIME=2
```

## Database

Prisma, our choice of Database ORM, requires a database to operate upon for nearly all interactions. If you are an ACM Officer
working on this project, contact the appropriate officer to acquire the Database URL.

The database URL should be placed in `.env` in the root directory:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://{username}:{password}@{domain}:{port}/{database}
```

Under no circumstances should this file be removed from `.gitignore` and committed to _any branch_.

If you don't have access to that database URL and would like a local database instance to work with,
Docker is an excellent option.

```dockerfile
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=admin
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
    ports:
      - '39755:5432'
    volumes:
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  db:
    driver: local
```

Paste the above inside a `docker-compose.yml` file (anywhere), then execute `docker-compose up -d` to run it in the background.

To stop the container, execute `docker-compose stop`, and to delete it, `docker-compose rm --stop` (stop & delete).
Find more commands [here][docker-compose-ref].

The `DATABASE_URL` here would be `postgresql://admin:password@localhost:39755/postgres`.
The port mapping chosen here is arbitrary (high port number reduces chances of appearance in a port exclusion range).
Change as you wish. Details [here][docker-compose-networking].

Once created, the database will need to be updated with the current schema. Execute [`yarn prisma db push`][prisma-db-push].
This command should not be used for _existing_ DBs.

## Migration

Prisma's database should be very carefully migrated, especially so in production environments.
If you do not have 100% confidence in what you are doing, you should not be attempting to migrate the database.

1. Someone else migrated the database and now my version doesn't match up!
   1. `git checkout main` and `git pull`. Unless something is going wrong, the latest database migration should be
      committed into `main`.
   2. Execute `npx prisma generate`. This will generate a new query engine and update your bindings forcibly.
      - `npx` forces execution of the latest version of Prisma, ensuring the latest version (and not whatever is in
        your local installation) is used.

## Separation of Server and Client

With our client and server so closely outfitted together, it is important to know how easily
the client may try to access resources it simply should not be attempting to. This is primarily
when dealing with environment variables.

Like most web applications, ours is provided credentials to the services it needs through
environment variables; database URLs and such. A number of other important pieces of data are
accessed here as well, such as the static administrator login and the environment type.

Here is one simple example of how importing something in the wrong spot can lead to the client breaking.

- `/member/status.tsx` includes `{ OpenGraph }` from `OpenGraph.tsx`
- `OpenGraph.tsx` includes `{ ltrim }` from `utils/helpers.ts`
- `utils/helpers.ts` contains `validateMember`, which has a type of `Member`, re-exported from `@prisma/client` inside `/server/db/client.ts`
  - This is nothing more than a type, not a function or constant, used for the Typescript transpiler.
- `/server/db/client.ts` uses the `NODE_ENV` environment variable provided to the server.

The issue here is that `helpers.ts` contains methods that access server-side resources whilst being
accessed by the client. If a server-side resource is being accessed, it should be moved to not
be alongside client-side methods.
